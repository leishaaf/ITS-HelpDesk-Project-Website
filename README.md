Simple website I created for ITS Help Desk as a resource page and to provide common information users seek out.
Displays our weekly hours on main campus as well as a link to our detailed locations and durations of workdays.
Also contains links to common troubleshooting guides.
Guides are either existing links to KB articles or guides made by me using simple HTML templates.
